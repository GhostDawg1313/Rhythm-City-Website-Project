        <h1>History of Rhythm City</h1>
        <p>The birth and history of Rhythm City began around Mid-August of 1997, and it was originally called Rainbow Coalition Incorporated…It had a total of eight members total…Started by Robert Holmes and Jerry somebody, the band continuously rejected the Name and came to an agreement that they would use the letters from the name to spell R.C.I. 
            After securing a new bass player (Greg “babyface” Bowie) and new drummer (Jerry “Duke-C” Riggs) and an additional Keyboard player (Mark “Markie-V” Vanweelden) the band took on a new sound and direction. Not long after a few failed gigs in which no one was getting paid much, the members William “Stevie-O” Houston, Duane ”Big” Jackson, Greg “Babyface” Bowie, Jerry “Duke- C,” Riggs and Mark “Markie-V” Vanweelden decided that they should cut the extra unneeded weight and added a new seasoned guitar player, (Grover “Groovin” Lipkins) to the roster. 
        Then they collectively decided to change the name, slowly fading out the name R.C.I. while using the letters of the previous name to form the new name without anyone noticing the difference. Rhythm City was born with a newsletter that had the title, R.C.I. which stood for “Rhythm City Information.” This clever move to change the song selections to a more danceable, energetic yet vintage type with the performances to match, started to have this band take off. Every member participated in the image, performance, song selection which took to better gigs, better pay and better exposure.
        In 2000 the band took a different turn when Greg and Stevie left the band to pursue other musical interest and Big and Markie-V carried the band outside of the Omaha Area to other venues including Casinos. The Band finally disbanded in 2008.
        In 2017, Duane had decided to promote an event for his musical family, in which his grandfather Vernon Garrett would headline, and the younger generation would perform a couple of hip hop sets. At this time, he asked if we wanted to get together to play our set as a reunion event. We were excited to play together after 20yrs, even though they were not billed as the headliner. This had ignited a fire under the band…. which they now have again as they approach the 25yr mark.

        <h3>Stevie-O</h3>
        <p> Stevie-O began his musical adventure when he was just 10yrs old with his first instrument being the Clarinet, after the clarinet he learned the Tenor Saxophone in which he played in his first band called Love etc. This band along with many others were students under his first mentor Chuck Miller, who was a teacher at the North Omaha Boys Club. Then he learned the flute and oboe. Later, before he turned 17, he had taught himself to play the bass guitar, drums and finally, the piano. The ability to acquire these instruments propelled him into songwriting and after he left the band E.T.C. (formally known as Love etc.…) he started a band called Royal and after that had disbanded, he started another band called Klass with some close friends and in the aftermath of the group disbanding he enlisted in the army. Stationed in Fort Bliss he had access to recording studios and practice room, it was there where he honed his skills as a drummer and songwriter. After some time there, he was stationed in Korea. While in the army he was recruited into another band called The Ice Band. He was recruited as the band’s drummer and lead vocalist. This band won various talent competitions and awards from many Army Generals because of the entertainment value they exhibited. After leaving the Army, Stevie-O met with a man that would soon be his second mentor to him both in music recording and in life. The Avenue was created out of this close friendship because Stevie-O decided that he should take a new approach to getting his music out by creating the band and the Music company EUNEVA, which is Avenue spelled backwards. In 1990 the band released the cassette single “Stuck on Stupid” with the B-side called “Copycat Characters”. The song made it to no.98 on the Billboard’s R&B charts. The band Disbanded and Stevie-O started another band Called Black and Mild in which they spelled their name like a license plate “BLKNMLD” This band consisted of four members and Stevie-O played all the music. Then after Stevie-O acquired a college degree, he was approached to join Rainbow Coalition Incorporated which later changed to Rhythm City. After leaving Rhythm City to concentrate more on writing and recording more music, he revived the band BLKNMLD (Black and Mild). Over the next ten years he perfected his drumming and keyboarding skills and developed a new cultural musical vibe called REtrOtherapY. He briefly had the radio show on the now defunct Mind and Soul 101.3 radio station located in the Malcom X Foundation building in Omaha Nebraska. Now he’s back with the Fellas for one more reunion tour adventure.</p>
